# Rules of the Game

1. **Vampires only**:  
   You are only allowed to play or engage in battles using only *vampires* or *vampire lords*.  

2. **Secondary Heroes**:  
   - Secondary heroes are permitted, but their army must consist of exactly one *skeleton*.  
   - If you recruit a new hero, immediately dismiss their starting army and replace it with one *skeleton*.  

3. **Castle Garrison**:  
   Do not leave any troops in the castle garrison. Always dismiss any surplus units.  

4. **Adventure Map Army**:  
   Any army gained from Adventure Map sources (such as dwellings, conservatories, or Pandora's boxes) must be dismissed, unless the units are *vampires* or *vampire lords*.  

## Gameplay Variation

1. **Stricter Vampires only**:  
You can further restrict secondary heroes by requiring them to use a *vampire* or *vampire lord* instead of a *skeleton*.
